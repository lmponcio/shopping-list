# shopping-list
A Google App Script for use at home. It retrieves a shopping list from a products spreadsheet. 

If multiple housemates share the sheet then everyone can modify the amounts needed in ¨All Products¨ sheet. Once everyone is happy, just click the button and items with amount bigger than 0 will be extracted. Please see the demo below:

This was my first time experimenting with Google App Script (trying to transfer my Excel VBA knowledge into google spreadsheets).
Hopefully someone out there finds this small tool useful - I will be using it at home and maybe improve it in the future.
If any feedback in the way I organized the code I welcome the help - I am happy to learn :).
